Intro to Relational Databases

Part 1: Data and Tables

1. Welcome to RDB
Project = Relational Concepts, SQL Queries, Python DB-API, More SQL, Final Project (plan a game tournament)

2. What's a Database
All DB have features: persistent storage, safe concurrent access by multiple programs/users
Relational DB also have: flexible query language, constraints (rules for protecting data consistency)

3. Looking at Tables

4. Quiz: Data Types and Meaning

5. Quiz: Data Meanings

6. Zoo

7. Anatomy of a Table

8. Answering Questions from a Table

9. Aggregations
count, avg, max, min, sum.
Note that 'count' works on everything while the others only work on numbers. 

10. Queries and Results
Restrictions implies rows

11. How Queries Happen
sqlite is for colocations i.e. one machine and no network/tcpip involved
others include oracle, postresql, mysql
Results from a database are a table of rows
select 2+2 as sum; gives a 1 row back (sum is the title of the table now)

14. Uniqueness and Keys
A column that uniquely identifies the rows in a table can be called a Primary Key (e.g. countries in the world)

15. Primary Key
A entry must exist in every row for a column to be a primary key (and be unique)

16. Joining Tables
Join on species  -->  restrictions  -->  count
e.g. animals = table with columns: name,species; diet = table with columns: species, food 
    select animals.name,animals.species,diet.food 
       from animals join diet 
       on animals.species=diet.species 
       where food='fish';

17. Database Concepts
ID's need to be unique and ID's can link up rows in different tables.
